# Functional Programming - Lambdas and Streams

Functional Programming with Lambdas and Streams is an exciting addition to Java Programming Langauage - Java 8

Understanding Lambdas::
* Lambdas enables Functional Programming
* Lambdas help us to write Readable and Concise Code
* Easier to use better APIs and libraries
* Lambdas enables support for parallel processing


Using Lambdas::
* Functions as Values

Functional Interfaces::
* Lambda as Interface Type
* Lambdas vs Interface Implementations
* Interface implementations implements a Class
* Lambdas implements a function
* Type Inference
* Why an Interface Type for Lambda?
** Backward Compatibility
** Lambdas works with legacy APIs
** Code Example using Runnable
*Lambdas vs Objects
*Object Reference Example


## Method References

Another way of writing Lambda expressions
More Concise and Expressional


## Collection Improvements in the context of Lambdas

Internal Iterations
Stream
